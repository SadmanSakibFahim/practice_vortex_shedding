ANSYS Fluent is used as the CFD tool in this project. 

A cylinder of diameter D was placed in a free stream of air having velocity U with the cylinder center on the midplane between the top and bottom walls of the domain.
This study focuses on generating the Coefficient of Lift force data in order to analyse the vortex shedding frequency of the system. 
The Strouhal number is also computed from the Cl vs time data.

Other results include: velocity contour animation, vorticity contours, onset of periodicity analysis, energy spectrum analysis.

Parameters: D = 0.05 m, domHeight = 0.1 m, domLength = 1 m, U = 100 m/s
